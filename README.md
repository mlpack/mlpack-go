This repository contains the *Go bindings* for mlpack.  These bindings are
auto-generated, and so this repository is not really maintained or monitored.

If you are *looking for the documentation* for the Go bindings, try here:

 * [Go quickstart tutorial](https://www.mlpack.org/doc/quickstart/go.html)
 * [Go binding documentation](https://www.mlpack.org/doc/user/bindings/go.html)

If you are *having trouble* or *want to learn more*, try looking in the main
mlpack repository:

 * [mlpack/mlpack](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/)

Any issues with the Go bindings should be filed there.
